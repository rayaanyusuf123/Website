# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website, a space where I bring together my love for coding, reading, and education. This project is a culmination of the skills I've learned in coding, designed to serve as both a personal portfolio and a resource hub for high school students and young adults. So stay awhile and get to know me, I promise you'll enjoy it. (hopefully)
